MathNotes: Attempt to Explain Math, Pure & Simple  
=================================================

This code tree is a bunch of Jupyter Notebooks designed to explain math to
common man in simple terms. Each notebook contains the complete explanation for
a topic with graphs, equation and commentry. The pages can be viewed on the
website itself (following the link), or can be downloaded and viewed locally on
your system. You will need Jupyter Notebook installed for local viewing and
editing.

## Topics

### [Aliasing](aliasing/aliasing.ipynb)
Aliasing is a very egragious signal processing design problem that every
engineer and DIYer should know. What if the pitch of your audio changes
unexpectedly, or your control system has unknown frequencies in it?

Open [this notebook](aliasing/aliasing.ipynb) to know more.

### [Convolution [WIP]](convolution/convolution.ipynb)
Convolution sums look complicated, but they describe a very simple phenomenon.
Everything from how you sound over the phone to how spacecrafts vibrate in
flight. Most people already have real-life experience of convolution, but dont
recognize its formalization.

Open [this notebook](convolution/convolution.ipynb) to know more.
